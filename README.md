# np_internship/grace portfolio
This project is all about the use of html and css to create a responsive webpage. A portfolio is a summary of a person's career. So as an Intern, I am practicing programming by creating a portfolio from a figma design.

The project consist of a navigation bar and a five section content. It is easily accessible and provides a better way of presenting a personal career summary in details.

This is basically made up of just html and css. I used Visual Code Studio for writing my codes and google chrome as my browser for viewing the webpage that was created. Github is where all my projects are stored and lastly notepad to take down important pointd from learning.

To view projects on the internet, first open a browser and then type https://emamoke.github.io/np_internship/graceportfolio/ (My first internship project)
